    rll - Rogelike Library for Perl

SYNOPSIS
     package myarea;
     use base 'rll::area';

     $r = myarea->new(w=>80,h=>50,dispw=>40,disph=>18);     # creates a area with specified width/height & map display width/height
     $r->genmaze2();                                        # make a cavelike maze
     $char = rll::mob->new($r, sym=>'@');                   # add a mobile object with symbol '@'
     $r->setvp($char);                                      # set viewpoint to be from Bob's perspective
     $r->setpov(8);                                         # set pov (sight) area to be distance 8
     $r->drawmap();                                         # draw the map
     while (!((my $c = $r->getch()) eq 'q')) {
            $char->kbdmove($c);
            $r->drawmap();
     }

DESCRIPTION
    library for pulling together field of view, character handling and map
    drawing code.

            * rll::area is the main "area" object
            * uses the rll::console library to draw the map
            * assumes the user will be using overridden rll::mob's as characters in the game
